There has been some confusion about Bitcoin Core’s communication channels, and the ways in which it interacts with the broad Bitcoin community. We’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the specific communication channels Core utilizes, and the manner by which it does so.

The bitcoincore.org website is now the official website for the Bitcoin Core project. Other websites may also host information about Bitcoin Core, but they are not under the control of the Bitcoin Core project. We know that the Bitcoin ecosystem can be confusing, and we are working hard to make these relationships more clear.

For development work, Bitcoin Core mainly uses the `#bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel on Freenode, [Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and [the bitcoin-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/). We also recently created a community [Slack group](https://bitcoincore.slack.com) (request an invitation [here](https://slack.bitcoincore.org)) to enable the greater Bitcoin community to connect with Bitcoin Core developers and contributors more easily.

Historically, Bitcoin.org was used by Satoshi Nakamoto to host his [Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Soon after, it began linking to downloadable versions of the original Bitcoin software, making it the homepage for the [Bitcoin program](https://bitcoin.org/en/download). The site evolved into a general educational resource for Bitcoin, and various Bitcoin wallets and services. The site is not owned or [controlled](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/about-site) by the Bitcoin Core project.

Additionally, while there are many forums in which the Bitcoin community and, indeed, Bitcoin Core contributors engage, Bitcoin Core is not responsible for those forums or their policies, nor does Bitcoin Core take official positions on the community's decisions to use them. Still, we believe it is critical that the Bitcoin community be able to freely discuss and critique every aspect of Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin community can become extremely excited and heated when discussing Bitcoin, but we must all work to maintain a civil tone. Community members should not engage in brigading, denial-of-service attacks, or otherwise disrupt healthy discussion and we should all do our best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise.
